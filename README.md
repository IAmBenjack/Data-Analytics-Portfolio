# Business Analytics Nanodegree
In this program, I learnt foundational data skills that apply across functions and industries, and I also learnt to analyze data and build models with Excel, query databases using SQL, and create informative data visualizations with Tableau.

# Project 1: Interpret a Data Visualization
In this project, I explored an interactive data dashboard to uncover insights, wrote a short report explaining each insight and how I found the information to reach my conclusion from the dashboard.

# Project 4 Build Data Dashboards
In this project, I applied design and visualization principles to create impactful data visualizations, built data dashboards, and told stories with the data, Built interactive dashboards with Tableau and used them to discover and communicate insights from a dataset of flight delays in the US to visualize reasons for delays, causes of flight cancellation, find the average airtime spent by each airline, and more.
