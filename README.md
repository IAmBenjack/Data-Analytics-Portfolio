# Business Analytics Nanodegree
In this program, I learnt foundational data skills that apply across functions and industries, and I also learnt to analyze data and build models with Excel, query databases using SQL, and create informative data visualizations with Tableau.

# Project 1: Interpret a Data Visualization
In this project, I explored an interactive data dashboard to uncover insights. I wrote a short report explaining each insight, and how I found the information to reach my conclusion from the dashboard.

# Project 2: Analyze NYSE Data
In this project, I used statistics and visuals to find and communicate insights, I used Excel skills to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data from over 500 companies on the New York Stock Exchange in a spreadsheet, I built Excel models to analyze possible business outcomes, and Forecasted financial metrics based on three possible scenarios for various companies of my choice from the NYSE dataset.
