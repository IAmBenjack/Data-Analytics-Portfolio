# Business Analytics Nanodegree
In this program, I learnt foundational data skills that apply across functions and industries, and I also learnt to analyze data and build models with Excel, query databases using SQL, and create informative data visualizations with Tableau.

# Project 1: Interpret a Data Visualization:
In this project, I explored an interactive data dashboard to uncover insights. I wrote a short report explaining each insight, and how I found the information to reach my conclusion from the dashboard.
