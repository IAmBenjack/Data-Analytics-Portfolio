In this project, I queried a digital music store database which holds information regarding the storeâ€™s media, employees, and customers, and Extracted and analyzed data stored in databases to help the store gain an understanding of the types of music that were purchased, where customers live, and how the company might optimize their business practices.

# Project 4 Build Data Dashboards
In this project, I applied design and visualization principles to create impactful data visualizations, built data dashboards, and told stories with the data, Built interactive dashboards with Tableau and used them to discover and communicate insights from a dataset of flight delays in the US to visualize reasons for delays, causes of flight cancellation, find the average airtime spent by each airline, and more.
